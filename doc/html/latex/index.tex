\section{Introduction}\label{index_intro_sec}
The R\+OS support package from Commonplace Robotics GmbH provides integration for C\+PR Mover and igus Robolink robots into the R\+OS ecosystem. It features\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Classes that can be used to control robots using R\+OS topics. 
\item U\+R\+DF robot definition files, that can for example be used to visualize the state of C\+PR robots in R\+Viz or similar tools. 
\item A simple R\+Viz plugin allowing to control C\+PR robots from within R\+Viz. 
\item Running example targetting the igus robolink 4\+D\+OF, small version. 
\item Running example targetting the C\+PR Mover6. 
\end{DoxyItemize}\section{Getting started}\label{index_getstarted}
\subsection{System Requirements}\label{index_requirements}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The package has been developed and tested on Ubuntu 18.\+04 with R\+OS melodic using the G\+NU 8.\+3 C++ toolchain. 
\item A C++17 capable compiler will be required in any case. 
\item In order to physically connect robots you will need a U\+SB to C\+AN adapter, testing was done with an {\tt adapter from P\+E\+AK System}. 
\item We recommend setting your system locale to E\+N-\/\+US because some R\+OS components seem to have trouble parsing floating point numbers in X\+ML files, if commas are used instead of points to separate the fractional part of floating point numbers by the system locale. 
\item We recommend having a good C++ editor of your choice at hands, the command line examples on this page will assume {\tt Microsoft Visual Studio Code} is installed on your machine -\/ it is what has been used during developement of the package in conjunction with the following plugins\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\tt C/\+C++ Intelli\+Sense, debugging, and code browsing} 
\item {\tt C\+Make langage support} 
\item {\tt Extended C\+Make support} 
\item {\tt Development support for Robot Operating System} 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}\subsection{Installation}\label{index_install}
\subsubsection{1. Prerequisites}\label{index_step1}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Make sure to have R\+OS melodic (or later) properly installed and configured on your machine. The {\tt instructions} provided from the {\tt R\+OS wiki} might be helpful doing so. 
\item The package is designed to be built using {\tt catkin\+\_\+make}. You will need a properly configured {\tt catkin workspace}. This {\tt tutorial} may be helpful setting it up. 
\end{DoxyItemize}\subsubsection{2. Clone and build the repository}\label{index_step2}
The source code for the package can be downloaded from our {\tt github repository}. 
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Clone the package sources by typing the following commands into a terminal from within the root folder of your catkin workspace\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
cd src
git clone https://github.com/CPR-Robots/cpr\_robot 
cd ..
\end{DoxyCode}
  
\item It may be advisable to reconfigure the C\+Make cache and clean the build folder. To do so, from within the root folder of your catkin workspace, type the following into a terminal\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
catkin\_make clean
catkin\_make rebuild\_cache
\end{DoxyCode}
  
\item Now it is time to actually build the package. From within the root folder of your catkin workspace type the following into a terminal\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
catkin\_make
\end{DoxyCode}
  
\item Finally let\textquotesingle{}s install the package. From within the root folder of your catkin workspace type the following into a terminal\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
catkin\_make install
\end{DoxyCode}
  
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\subsubsection{3. Run the examples}\label{index_step3}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Make sure the robot ist connected to your computer via your C\+AN to U\+SB adapter and powered on.  
\item The C\+AN interface on your computer needs to be started, whenever the C\+AN to U\+SB adapter has been plugged in or the computer has started up. To do so, type the following into a terminal\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
sudo modprobe can\_dev
sudo modprobe can
sudo modprobe can\_raw
sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000
sudo ifconfig can0 up
\end{DoxyCode}
 It may be advisable to have a small shellscript with these commands, typing them again each time the adapter hase been plugged in may be cumbersome after a while.  
\item Run the R\+Viz plugin with one of the example robot nodes. 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item To control an igus robolink 4\+D\+OF, small version robot type the following into a terminal\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
roslaunch cpr\_robot igus\_4DOF\_SV.launch
\end{DoxyCode}
 
\item If you want to control a C\+PR Mover6 robot, type the following into a terminal\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
roslaunch cpr\_robot CPRMover6.launch
\end{DoxyCode}
  
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\subsubsection{4. Take a look at the source code}\label{index_step4}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Go to the package source folder\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
roscd cpr\_robot
\end{DoxyCode}
  
\item Open the folder using an editor (in this example Visual Studio Code is used)\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
code .
\end{DoxyCode}
  
\item Have fun playing around with it.  
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\section{Overview}\label{index_ovrview}
\subsection{The Robot node}\label{index_rbotnode}
See the files \doxyref{main\+\_\+\+C\+P\+R\+Mover6.\+cpp}{p.}{main__CPRMover6_8cpp} or \doxyref{main\+\_\+igus\+\_\+4\+D\+O\+F\+\_\+\+S\+V.\+cpp}{p.}{main__igus__4DOF__SV_8cpp} in order to have a working example on how to set up a R\+OS node that will allow to integrate robots from igus or C\+PR into R\+OS. The general way to do it, is to instantiate a class that has been derived from the abstract Robot base class, then within a standard R\+OS spinning loop subsequently call the Read, Publish\+State and Write methods\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
cpr_robot::CPRMover6 robot;
robot.Init();
ros::Rate loop\_rate(10);
\textcolor{keywordflow}{while} (ros::ok())
\{
  robot.Read();
  robot.PublishState();
  robot.Write();
  ros::spinOnce();
  loop\_rate.sleep();
\}
\end{DoxyCode}
\subsection{The R\+Viz plugin}\label{index_rvizplug}
The complete source code for the R\+Viz plugin is contained in the files \doxyref{Robot\+Panel.\+cpp}{p.}{RobotPanel_8cpp} and \doxyref{Joint\+Control.\+cpp}{p.}{JointControl_8cpp} and their respective headers. You can use these a a starting point for the developement of your own plugin. Note that you will have to run 
\begin{DoxyCode}
catkin\_make install
\end{DoxyCode}
 for Panels (and other R\+Viz plugins) to become accesible from within R\+Viz.\subsection{Dataflow schema}\label{index_diag}
